/* 
 *
 * Notes, ideas:
 * 
 * Represent un-stepped squares with a -1, everything else with a 0
 * Have a class for each square and see if its flagged or uncovered or a bomb
 * When making the game, check each square and see how many bombs it borders - if there is an error, simply continue the nested loop - should be around 5000 iterations so not too challenging
 * Get the first player click - there we can determine which squares will be mines and stuff
