# Minesweeper
A simple minesweeper game you can play on your Java terminal!

### Features: 
- Smooth text printing
- Colors for numbers and coordinate labels
- Random generation of map upon opening
- Ability to flag squares as you do in normal minesweeper
- Ability to control game size and mine frequency
- Much more!

### To Play: 
First, the game will ask you if you want to have smooth text printing enabled. After that, it explains the rules and how to move. The x-y coordinate system is explained, as well as the system for flagging.

When you begin playing, you can move anywhere and it will clear the field partially, as does the normal game. Then, you can keep entering moves until the game is over. 

The board at the start may look like this:

Then, after making your first move, the board will look something like this:

Then, after making several moves and losing, the board will look like this:
